* TODO

** log

   Bug: double quotes in any log message will definitely break things.

** tests

   - test_main should compare dot graph to golden dot graph. Maybe, use
     networkx?

   - Add a "command" input file to each test with the full gitdot command to run
     for the test. test_git.py should run argparse to pull out the --log-opt and
     --refs parts.

   - How should main test work? Open image only if running one test?

   - Add test with remote refs. Style remotes differently.

** refs

   - Make a =--refs= flag to customize git for-each-ref patterns.

   - Make a test that uses =git update-ref= to create some weird refs, like
     =refs/foo/bar/moo=.

** dot

   - Display nodes in a more git-like way. Ideas:

     - Any cluster of nodes with indegree=1 and outdegree=1 should be in a
       straight horizontal line (i.e. a subgraph).

     - Everything in =git config init.defaultBranch= should be in a straight line.

     - Everything in the current branch is in a straight line. (Nah...
       defaultBranch seems more natural).
